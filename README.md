# Stewy

Stewy is a Stewart platform designed as an educational tool. It is capable of moving its top plate around with 6 degrees of freedom and using its arms to lift its base for walking around.

Currently, the code in this repository is working, but needs to be cleaned up and better documented. These improvements will be completed by the end of Stewy's Kickstarter campaign. Please check the kickstarter page [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jdrobotics/stewy-learn-robotics-with-this-open-source-platform) for an overview and updates on the project.
